This is how input-output data come from OECD and not also from OECD, but also WIOD, etc. The cells of our table represent monetary sums. We calculate the production matrix, \\(\\textbf{A}\\) by using the following matrix formula:\n\\[\\textbf{A} = \\textbf{Z}\\textbf{x}^{-1}\\] Where \\(\\textbf{Z}\\) is the so called transaction table we have been mentioning, \\(\\textbf{x}\\) is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal entry represent the invers of the total production ( \\(x_{i,i}\\))."

As recommended by Miller and Blair (2009) we use the average of two polar decomposition.\n\\(\\Delta Va=\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta\\textbf{v}(\\textbf{L}_1\\textbf{f}_1 + \\textbf{L}_2\\textbf{f}_2) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\textbf{v}_1\\Delta\\textbf{L}\\textbf{f}_2+\\textbf{v}_2\\Delta\\textbf{L}\\textbf{f}_1)+\\frac{1}{2}(\\textbf{v}_1\\textbf{L}_1+\\textbf{v}_2\\textbf{L}_2)\\Delta\\textbf{f}\\)\nThe difference in the value added generated by final demand categories will be decomposed into three sums, each corresponding to changes in one of its constituent terms."

Let us see Romania first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that almost all the value added between 1995 and 2018 is due to final demand growing in this time. Also, exports are more important in the generation of value added since the Great Financial Crisis.\nLet us see Eastern Europe relative contribution to value added before and after the financial crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it was to be expected, our countries are now more export-oriented.\nWhy does Croatia look that way, also different from your study ?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is hard to see problems with graph so maybe we plot annual changes:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see more clearly now that we had negative (absolute) contributions from exports in a few years after the financial crisis and some constant contributions afterwards. They mostly cancel out but they remain positive (actually the only positive component in the 2009-2018 period). So we will use the math module function for the total value added so we can have positive contribution of positive components even when growth is negative.\nLet us see mediterranean/mixed economies:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd cumulative yearly changes:"
